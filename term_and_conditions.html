					<section><p>Last updated on January 22nd, 2023</p></section>
					
					<section>
						<p>Creward, the inquisitives must have found out, is slang for money.</p>
						<p>But what do we do, you ask?</p>
						<p>Well, let's start with a question then.</p>
						<p>Does money feel better flowing in or flowing out?</p>
						<p>I bet you said flowing in and in case you are a spendaholic you'd still know that in order for money to flow out it must first flow in. Damn, that's a lot of "flows".</p>
						
						<p>So, getting back to where we were, we help you increase your money flowing in.</p>
						<p>How???</p>
						<p>By helping you convert your liabilities into your assets. In simpler words, by earning money (cold hard cash) on using your Credit and Debit Cards.</p>
					</section>
					
					<section>
						<h3>1. Scope of the App Services</h3>
						
						<p>Creward Technologies Private Limited ("Creward") is the owner and controller of 'Creward' which is a web-based mobile application that provides a unified platform that primarily enables Credit and Debit Card holders in India to earn money via their cards by helping others avail discounts available on their cards at various online and offline merchants and includes other related facilities and services offered on Creward ("App Services") currently or in the future, where such services can be accessed via the internet either on mobile and desktop/laptop ("Creward" or "App").</p>
						
						<p>By accessing and using our Services (defined below), you ("Our User") are agreeing to these terms and conditions contained hereinafter ("Terms of Service" or "Terms"). We, Creward Technologies Private Limited, including its affiliates &amp; subsidiaries, strongly urge you to read the Terms of Service in detail before registering, accessing or using the App Services. Supplemental terms may apply to certain Services, such as new feature and such supplemental terms will be disclosed to you in connection with the applicable Services. Supplemental terms are in addition to, and shall be deemed a part of, the Terms for the purposes of the applicable Services. Supplemental terms shall prevail over these Terms in the event of a conflict with respect to the applicable Services.</p>
						
						<p>We may amend the Terms at any time by posting an updated version on the App. The updated version of these Terms shall supersede the previous version of the Terms and take effect immediately upon posting and may be notified, via the App. You have the right to opt-out of agreeing to these Terms or any future updated version of the Terms, and therefore also using the App. If you are not comfortable with any of the Terms or do not wish to be bound by the same, you are at liberty to refrain from using the App and the App Services. However, please be aware that your continued use of the App Services for a period of 7 (seven) days from the launch of any updated Terms would mean deemed acceptance of these Terms and its associated policies mentioned here, including any modification thereof.</p>
						
						<p>For the purpose of these Terms of Use, wherever the context so requires, the term "User" shall mean and include any natural or legal person who has agreed to these Terms of Use on behalf of itself or any other legal entity. It is clarified that the Privacy Policy (that is provided separately), form an integral part of these Terms of Use and should be read contemporaneously with the Terms of Use. Illegality or unenforceability of one or more provisions of these Terms of Use shall not affect the legality and enforceability of the other terms of the Terms of Use.
